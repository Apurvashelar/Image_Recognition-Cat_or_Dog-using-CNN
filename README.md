# Image_Recognition-Cat_or_Dog-using-CNN

### Description  
We've the dataset of total 8000 traning images and 2000 testing images of both cat and dog.  
This model is trained using Convolution Neural Network(CNN), so that it will predict the given input image is of cat or dog.  
 
 
### Concepts  
Here in this CNN algorithm, we've initialize different layers from keras library. First we've implemented convolution operation on the images, the we've defined max pooling layer to get the most relevent features. Then we flattened the images using flattening concept and then created a fully connected layer using dense module from keras. Finally there is an output layer, output of the model is in binary format i.e either the prediction is *Dog* or *Cat*.
